## Objective
This is to simulate a simple HTTP communication between two nodes via router using the ns-3 network simulator.
##  Topology
- The network topology consists of two nodes connected by a router between them.
- One node acts as an HTTP server, serving an HTML file, while other node acts as an HTTP client, requesting the file from the server.
- The network is stimulated with a bandwidth of 100Mbps and delay of 1ms (configurable) for each link.
## How to use
- Ensure you have the necessary ns-3 network simulator installed.
- Include the required ns-3 modules and libraries as stated in the code.
- Compile the code within the ns-3 environment.
- Run the compiled program to initiate the HTTP simulation.
## Output
If executed successfully then there will be a copy of the requested html file which will be present in files-2 folder.
