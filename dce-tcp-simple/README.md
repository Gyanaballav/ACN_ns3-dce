#dce-tcp-simple

##Objective:	
	It sets up a network with a single node having loopback interface
##Topology:    
	1 node having loopback interface

##Experience:  
	It demonstrates how to create a network and configure the network stack.


##How to use:     
	1. Make sure you have the ns-3 network simulation tool installed.
	2. Compile the code using the appropriate build system, such as ./waf
	3. Run the executable generated after compilation.
	4. The code will simulate the network for a specific duration and generate output related to the TCP loopback application.
			

##Output: 
	The output includes the simulation results of the TCP loopback application.
