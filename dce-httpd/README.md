##Objective:
	This is to simulate a simple HTTP communication between two nodes using the ns-3 network simulator.
	
##Topology:
	1. The network topology consists of two nodes connected by a point to point link.
	2. One node acts as an HTTP server, serving an HTML file, while other node acts as an HTTP client, requesting the file from the server.
	3. The network is stimulated with a bandwidth of 100Mbps and delay of 1ms(configurable).

##How to use:
	1. Ensure you have the necessary ns-3 network simulator installed.
	2. Include the required ns-3 modules and libraries as stated in the code.
	3. Compile the code within the ns-3 environment.
	4. Run the compiled program to initiate the HTTP simulation.
	
##Output:
	Output is blank unless there is an error.
